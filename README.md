====================
Compile-time reflection in rust!

The original use case is type-checking generated code in a JIT compiler (with zero runtime cost).
However, other use cases are certainly possible :)

Contributions are welcome!
I'd be happy to add more features as long as they align with the general philosophy
of compile-time reflection.

Unfortunately, there is very little documentation right now.
Hopefully that will change in the future.
